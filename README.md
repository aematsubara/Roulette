# Roulette
The classic casino game now in Minecraft, no need for texture packs.

# Roulette (Premium)
Roulette Premium is an enhanced version of Roulette, available at [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/roulette.77010/) and [Polymart](https://polymart.org/product/8472/roulette).

Full message from the developer on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MHZZHfMzgA):
>Hey @Roulette!
>
>I want to share some important news about Roulette and where the plugin is heading.
>
>I first released Roulette for free on Spigot back in July 2020. Since then, it’s grown way more than I expected, over 21,000 downloads and 76 reviews. Many servers have been using it for years, and I’m really grateful for all the support.
>
>But here’s the thing: I don’t work as a developer outside of Minecraft plugins, and my time is limited. The only way I can keep putting time into updates and improvements is by making Roulette a paid plugin.
>
>[So, from now on, Roulette will be available as a premium resource on BuiltByBit (aka. MC-Market)](https://builtbybit.com/resources/roulette.77010/)
>
>The premium version already includes several new features (and more coming soon):
>- All roulette bets implemented, including split, street, corner, six line, basket, and red snake.
>- Croupier tipping system with PlaceholderAPI support and custom thank-you messages.
>- Quick bet movement with a simple menu to switch slots.
>- Voucher rewards, only given when winnings exceed a set threshold.
>- Force winning slot option at any stage of the game.
>- `/roulette move <name>` command (self explanatory).
>- And much, much more!

>I know this is a big change, especially since Roulette has been free for so long. But this is the only way I can realistically keep the project alive and keep improving it. Thanks for understanding, and thanks for sticking with me through all these years.
>
>(Yes, you're allowed to be angry with me)
>
> I’ll keep updating Roulette on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/roulette.82197/), but only supporting newer Minecraft versions; no more features.
